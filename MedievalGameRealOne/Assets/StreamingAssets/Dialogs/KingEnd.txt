Oof... That was a rough fight.
I can only remember today. I guess, I was a killer back then.
I should return to the castle. From now on, no more killing.
If I can find the king, maybe we can end this war.
Why on earth someone wants to fight?

After that, the man has returned to the castle...
But something wasn't right...
Maybe there are other paths to see to learn the TRUTH...
The truth about the King and his brother Virgilius...
The case remains unsolved.
