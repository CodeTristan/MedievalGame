Anyways, next!

<
-Paiter
*Paiter
Phew... My shift is finally done.
Actually I'm the fortune teller of the king.
But he forced me to service to common people.
What a fucking great king he is, right?
NO! I hate him. He thinks he is rightful or just. 
But he is nothing more than a moron.
Anyways... Hey this is recording right?

Paiter checks his wrist. There is something attached to it.
Like a some sort of chip.
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
I want to be king...
I have a plan for that though, but I need someone.
It can't be done just by myself.
I should head to Virgilius' room.

-Paiter
*Paiter
Hey Virgilius, do you remember our plan?
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
Of course I do... If you mock about my memory again! That will be your last mockery!
When are we going to execute it. Thats what I want to learn.
You keep avoiding me, while this king is making peace deals.
Soon there won't be any wars. Which is bad for us right?
Right?
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
Ah... Yes. Of course... We want war...
First of all that night is tonight. 
We can't wait any longer. I can't stand beign a fortune teller.
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
What?
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
I mean, I can't stand this king anymore.
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
Me too... Even though he is my brother, he is a moron.
I want to hear screams again.
Screams of my enemies.
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
(Jeez... Okay you are a bad guy. We get it.)
Are you ready?
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
We should wait until everyone sleeps.
But there is always a guardian in front of his chambers.
You know him, Chadus.
We can kill him for sure, but It won't be an easy battle.
Plus we have to be silent.
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
Okay lets wait...
<
-
... After some time...
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
Shall we?
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
Lets go.

They walked to the chamber of the king.
There was a guardian waiting in front of the door.
<
-Chadus
*Chad
Back.
<
-Paiter
*Paiter
Hey... We don't want any trouble okay.
<
-Chadus
*Chad
Ok. And?

-Chadus
*Chad

-Virgilius
*Virgilius

-GUIDE
In battle screen, listen the music and follow the rhythm.
Press any of the "X", "Z" or "Space" buttons in the right time.
Be alert because sometimes enemy attacks cause your eyes to shut. So there will be no light for a few seconds.
Using "X" and "Z" simultaneously is recommended.
