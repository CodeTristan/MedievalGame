Hey Olga! Wake up sleepy!
Are you planning to sleep all day?
<
-Olga
*Olga
Is it noon already...
I better get up.
Good morning sunshine.
<
-Little Girl
Hey, don't call me that! 
<
-Olga
*Olga
Alright, alright...
(We are in a camp area in the outer regions of the forest.)
(I've found this girl, which refuses to tell me her name in woods.)
(In war times like this, you can find lots of orphans just like her.)
(I couldn't let her live in the woods, so I'll take her to our home.)
Hey are you hungry?
<
-Little Girl
Yes...
<
-Olga
*Olga
Then we should hunt some animals. Do you know how to hunt?
<
-Little Girl
No...
<
-Olga
*Olga
It's okay. You can learn.
Now come with me.

War huh?
<
-Little Girl
...
<
-Olga
*Olga
I've lost my kids at war too...
The knights, they are cruel...
<
-Little Girl
NO! Mommy still lives!
<
-Olga
*Olga
Sure, of course she lives.
But first, we will get you to a safe place. Okay?
<
-Little Girl
Okay...
<
-Olga
*Olga
(Her parents were killed in front of her.)
(Her mother's last wish was her child's safety. So I took her with me.)
Look! There is a deer!
Now be careful...

*Olga
I've managed to escape from it. But where is she?
HEEEYY! GIRL! WHERE ARE YOU!
<

No Response...
<
-Olga
*Olga
Shit... I must find her.
<
-Voice
GOD DAMMIT! WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY! ENOUGH ALREADY!
<
-Olga
*Olga
What was that? It was an adult man's voice.
It could be someone dangerous, maybe he kidnapped her.
I must check it out.

(Is it... Yea it can't be wrong... It's him. Virgilius.)
(The one who killed my kids and burned my hometown.)
(I've been looking for him for years. Now I found you alone...)
Who is there?
<
-Virgilius
*King
It's me. I'm here!
Can you help me? I can't get up. This stupid armor is so heavy.
<
-Olga
*Olga
It's you...
What are you doing in here? How dare you come back?
<
-Virgilius
*King
Yeeaa... It's me...
Can you help me get up?
<
-Olga
*Olga
You want help? After all you've done!
/*Places an arrow in her bow.*
Finally I can kill you. After all these years I searched for you.
<
-Virgilius
*King
Hey hey hey. Put the bow down. What did I do to you.
It is you guys who kidnapped our king right! 
You should be ashamed, kidnapping is a dishonored action!
<
-Olga
*Olga
Kidnapping king?
Why on earth would we do that! He is the one who wants to stop this idiotic war.
With his help, we can finally rest peacefully in our home without any concern.
<
-Virgilius
*King
So you didn't kidnap our king. Then who did?
<
-Olga
*Olga
I have no idea, but you will pay for your sins.
Burned our villages... Killed our family... even our children...
<
-Virgilius
*King
Holy shit... I did all of that? Damn... I'm sorry.
<
-Olga
*Olga
You are sorry?
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Stop it!
<
-Knight
HALT!
Leave our commander!
<
-Olga
*Olga
Shit...
I will see you again...
<
...
...
<
-Olga
*Olga
I've managed to escaped but...
Where is she?
There are footprints, one big and one small one...
She is indeed in a trouble.
I must hurry.
