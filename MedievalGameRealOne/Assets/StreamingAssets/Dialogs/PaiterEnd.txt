Paiter runs to outside of the castle.
There he sees Virgilius, talking with a woman and a child.
Virgilius tries to run away to the forest.
But Paiter stops him.

Virgilius was in a shock. But something is missing.
Maybe there are other paths to see to learn the TRUTH...
The truth about the King and his brother Virgilius...
The case remains unsolved.
