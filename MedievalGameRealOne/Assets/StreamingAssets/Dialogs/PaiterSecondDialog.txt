Paiter and Virgilius entered to the kings chamber.
Virgilius hit him with a mace while he was sleeping.

*Virgilius
He is dead.

-Paiter
*Paiter
You sure he is dead right?
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
Of course I am sure. I am fucking Knight Virgilius.
If I say he is dead. He is dead.

-Paiter
*Paiter
Alright, alright...
We can't let them find his body.
We must hide it.
<
-Virgilius
*Virgilius
Yeah... We should hide him somewhere.
Somewhere they won't even consider looking.
So that we can blame the kings death on forest people.
