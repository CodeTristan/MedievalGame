Ahahahahahaha. Do you think you can hurt me with that?
I am faster than you think.

-GUIDE
In battle screen, listen the music and follow the rhythm.
Press any of the "X", "Z" or "Space" buttons in the right time.
Be alert because sometimes enemy attacks cause your eyes to shut. So there will be no light for a few seconds.
Using "X" and "Z" simultaneously is recommended.
