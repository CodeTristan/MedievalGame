You know... We sell you weapons and you keep fighting. In the end, you will let me live inside the castle.
But that stupid king wants to end the war. We can't let that happen, can we?
Otherwise, how are we going to get rich right?

The king has been kidnapped? What! When?
Ohohoho... Thats very good.
It was about time someone killed that idiot.
You know the ones who want to fight will always find a way.
If you be a peaceful king like that. You will get killed eventually.

-GUIDE
In battle screen, listen the music and follow the rhythm.
Press any of the "X", "Z" or "Space" buttons in the right time.
Be alert because sometimes enemy attacks cause your eyes to shut. So there will be no light for a few seconds.
If you manage to get at least %60, you win the battle.
