Belgio forest is one of the biggest forest in these lands.
But it is known for it's rocky terrain. Horses can't go inside of this forest easily.
Thus, forest people can defend their lands with their special bows and arrows against mighty knights.

Sir Virgilius has fallen down! Go find him!
<
-Virgilius
*King
Damn... That was a long fall...
These lands are so damn slippery and also full of rocks!
GOD DAMMIT! WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY! ENOUGH ALREADY!
First my memory, then this...
<
-Voice
Who is there?
<
-Virgilius
*King
It's me. I'm here!
Can you help me? I can't get up. This stupid armor is so heavy.
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
It's you...
What are you doing in here? How dare you come back?
<
-Virgilius
*King
Yeeaa... It's me...
(Oh god what a stunning woman...)
Can you help me get up?
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
You want help? After all you've done!
/*Places an arrow in her bow.*
Finally I can kill you. After all these years I searched for you.
<
-Virgilius
*King
Hey hey hey. Put the bow down. What did I do to you.
It is you guys who kidnapped our king right! 
You should be ashamed, kidnapping is a dishonored action!
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
Kidnapping king?
Why on earth would we do that! He is the one who wants to stop this idiotic war.
With his help, we can finally rest peacefully in our home without any concern.
<
-Virgilius
*King
So you didn't kidnap our king. Then who did?
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
I have no idea, but you will pay for your sins.
Burned our villages... Killed our family... even our children...
<
-Virgilius
*King
Holy shit... I did all of that? Damn... I'm sorry.
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
You are sorry?
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Stop it!
<
-Knight
HALT!
Leave our commander!
<
-Forest Lady
*Olga
Shit...
I will see you again...
<

Forest lady escapes from knights...
<
-Knight
Sir, are you alright sir!
<
-Virgilius
*King
Yea... Can you help me to get up?
Thanks...
You guys can go back to the castle. King is not in here.
<
-Knight
Are you sure sir?
<
-Virgilius
*King
Yes I am. Now go!
<
-Knight
Sir, yes sir!
<
-Virgilius
*King
Damn... Have I really killed all those people?
That lady has gone deep into forest. I must find her and learn about my past.
